Starting a new project
======================
1) open VSCode, click on the Particle icon
2) Ctrl+Shift+p, type particle, choose Start New Project, select parent folder, type a project name.
3) The software code is under src, in <project_name>.ino
4) Dependencies:
	in project.properties, e.g. the following were used with the Photon
		dependencies.photon-vbat=0.0.3
		dependencies.SparkFunMAX17043=1.1.2
5) https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/
6) Add libraries by Ctrl+Shft+p and selecting "particle library add"
7) https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/libraries/
8) Set up the DeviceOS and target device: Particle: Configure Workspace for Device.
9) Make sure the local compiler is installed if you're not going tocloud compile:
	Particle: Install Local Compiler.
9b) Install the Particle CLI (which also installs the Particle USB drivers)
9c) Run "particle setup" from a cmd terminal
9d) Make sure you are logged in on VS Code: Particle: Login	 -> important as this gives you the access token you need.
10) Compile and  Flash:
	Particle: Flash application (local)
	Particle: Flash application for debug (local)
	Particle: Flash application & Device OS (local)
11) Mark development devices as such using the console: https://console.particle.io/devices
		See also https://console.particle.io/devices
12) Setting up hardware:
			Use the Particle App (Tinker) to claim and set up credentials, or
			https://setup.particle.io/
13) Software reference to the DeviceOS:
